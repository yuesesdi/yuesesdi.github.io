Yuesesdi pronounced as U-S-S-D is prepaid utility app in the Philippines. It currently supports Globe, TM, Smart and Talk 'N Text. Yuesesdi is a faster way to inquire USSD.

**Features**
 - Explore prepaid promos
 - Inquire/Register prepaid promos
 - Borrow regular prepaid load
 - Access GCash without internet access
 - Send Money, Buy Load and Pay Bills with your GCash account

To be fair, you can do this with simply dialing the conventional USSD. However, by using Yuesesdi you save yourself time from inputing each indices depending on the inquiry.

**For example, this is what a typical USSD output look like.**

 1. Account
 2. Balance
 3. Promos

Each of these indices contains another directory of indices. The user enters the indices, let us say number 1 and then click send. It would then take another 5 seconds or two to complete the request. This is cumbersome for most users, especially if they live in a low reception area. Yuesesdi solves this problem by automating the input. Just browse through the Yuesesdi app and choose your inquiry and Yuesesdi will do the job for you.
