# Version 7.5

The release of Yuesesdi version 7.5 was one of the biggest changes in Yuesesdi history yet.

On Dec 2020, Globe Telecom disabled the functionality to dial shortcut USSD codes (e.g, \*143\*1#), this might be an attempt to obsolesce the Yuesesdi app. We are not 100% certain but it is highly likely. We ultimately responded with a new release.

Version 7.5 and above is resistant to the changes made by Globe Telecom. Yuesesdi is extremely secure and free to use. We recommend downloading Yuesesdi only in the Google Play Store at the time of this writing. We are also open on working with telecom companies.
