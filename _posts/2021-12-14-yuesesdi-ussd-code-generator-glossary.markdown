# Glossary

**Path**

A path is a series of USSD codes. A path could be a root \*123#, or a series of indices \*123\*1\*2#.

---

**Parent Path**

Previous path of the current path. For example, currently we are in the path of \*123\*1\*2# the parent path would be \*123\*1#.

Dialing parent paths are useful if you haven't updated your directories for a long period of time. You might want to see if the index and content is equal.

**Directories**

Directories are a series of USSD codes. A directory could either be shallow or deep.
